### Websocket:
* WebSockets provide a two-way (full-duplex) communication channel between the client and server over a single * * TCP(Transmission Control Protocol) connection.

   ## How it works:
     * With HTTP, the client requests, and the server responds (one-way).
     * With WebSockets, both client and server can send messages anytime after the connection is established.

  ## Implementation Steps:
    * Install socket.io
    * require http module and  Imports the Server class from the socket.io library
    * create server from http.createServer(app)
